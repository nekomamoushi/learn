# AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner

## Cloud Computing

- On-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
- Through a cloud services platform with pay-as-you-go pricing
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need
- You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly
- Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services
- Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application.

### Advantages of the Cloud:

1. **Trade capital expense for variable expense**
   Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.
2. **Benefit from massive economies of scale**
   By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.
3. **Stop guessing about capacity**
   Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.

4. **Increase speed and agility**
   In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.
5. **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centres**
   Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.
6. **Go global in minutes**
   Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.

### Problems solved by the Cloud

- **Flexibility**: Change resource types when needed
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Pay as you go, for what you use
- **Scalability**: Accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes
- **Elasticity**: Ability to scale out and scale-in when needed
- **High-availability and Fault-tolerance**: Build across data centers
- **Agility**: Rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

### Types of Cloud Computing

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
  Provide building blocks for cloud IT (Networking, Computers, Data storage, etc...)
  Highest level of flexibility
  Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
  Examples: Amazon EC2 (on AWS), GCP, Azure

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
  Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure
  Focus on the deployment and management of your applications
  Examples: Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS), Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft)

- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
  Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
  Examples: Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning), Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom

## Cloud Computing Types

- **Cloud** (Fully hosted on Cloud such as startups)
- **Hybrid** (On-Premise and Public Cloud such as Banks)
- **On-Premise** (On Private Cloud where sensitive data is being stored).

### Pricing of the Cloud

3 pricing fundamentals:

- **Compute**: Pay for compute time
- **Storage**: Pay for data stored in the Cloud
- **Data transfer OUT**: Data transfer IN is free
