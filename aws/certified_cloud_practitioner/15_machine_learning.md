# Machine Learning

## Rekognition

- Find objects, people, text, scenes in images and videos using ML
- Facial analysis and facial search to do user verification, people counting
- Create a database of “familiar faces” or compare against celebrities
- Use cases:
  - Labeling
  - Content Moderation
  - Text Detection
  - Face Detection and Analysis
  - Face Search and Verification
  - Pathing (ex: for sports game analysis)

## Transcribe

- Automatically convert speech to text
- Uses a deep learning process called automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert speech to text quickly and accurately
- Use cases:
  - transcribe customer service calls
  - automate closed captioning and subtitling
  - generate metadata for media assets to create a fully searchable archive

## Polly

- Turn text into lifelike speech using deep learning
- Allowing you to create applications that talk

## Translate

- Natural and accurate language translation
- Amazon Translate allows you to localize content - such as websites and applications - for international users, and to easily translate large volumes of text efficiently.

## Amazon Lex

Amazon Lex: (same technology that powers Alexa)

- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to convert speech to text
- Natural Language Understanding to recognize the intent of text, callers
- Helps build chatbots, call center bots

## SageMaker

- Fully managed service for developers / data scientists to build ML models
- Typically difficult to do all the processes in one place + provision servers
- Machine learning process (simplified): predicting your exam score

## Comprehend

Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. No machine learning experience required.
