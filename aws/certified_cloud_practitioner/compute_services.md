# Compute Services

## Elastic Container Service (ECS)

It provides a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances.

Amazon ECS eliminates the need for you to install, operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructure.

- You must provision & maintain the infrastructure (EC2 instances)
- AWS takes care of starting / stopping containers
- Has integrations with the Application Load Balancer

## Fargate

- Serverless compute engine for containers
- Deploy and manage applications, not infrastructure (no EC2 to manage)
- AWS just runs containers for you based on the CPU / RAM you need
- Secure isolation by design
- Pricing based on the vCPU and memory resources used from the time you start to download your container image until ECS Task or EKS Pod terminates, rounded up to the nearest second.

## Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

EKS gives you the flexibility to start, run, and scale Kubernetes applications in the AWS cloud or on-premises. Amazon EKS helps you provide highly-available and secure clusters and automates key tasks such as patching, node provisioning, and updates.

## Elastic Container Registry (ECR)

- Private Docker Registry on AWS
- This is where you store your Docker images so they can be run by ECS or Fargate

### Lambda

- Virtual functions (no servers to manage)
- Short executions (up to 15 minutes)
- Run on-demand
- Scaling is automated

Pricing:

- Pay per request and compute time
- Free tier:
  - 1,000,000 AWS Lambda requests
  - 400,000 GBs of compute time
- $0.20 per 1 million requests thereafter (calls)
- After that $1.00 for 600,000 GB-seconds (duration)

Supported Language:

- Node.js
- Python
- Java (Java 8 compatible)
- C# (.NET Core)
- Golang
- C# / Powershell
- Ruby
- Custom Runtime API
- Lambda Container Image
  - The container image must implement the Lambda Runtime API
  - ECS / Fargate is preferred for running arbitrary Docker images

### Lightsail

Amazon Lightsail is great for users who do not have deep AWS technical expertise as it make it very easy to provision compute services.

Amazon Lightsail provides developers compute, storage, and networking capacity and capabilities to deploy and manage websites, web applications, and databases in the cloud.

Amazon Lightsail includes everything you need to launch your project quickly â€“ a virtual machine, SSD-based storage, data transfer, DNS management, and a static IP.

Amazon Lightsail provides preconfigured virtual private servers (instances) that include everything required to deploy and application or create a database.

- Virtual servers, storage, databases, and networking
- Low & predictable pricing
- Simpler alternative to using EC2, RDS, ELB, EBS, Route 53...
- Can setup notifications and monitoring of your Lightsail resources

Use cases:

- Simple web applications
- Websites
- Dev/Test environment
- High availability but no auto-scaling, limited AWS integrations

### Batch

- Fully managed batch processing at any scale
- Efficiently run 100,000s of computing batch jobs on AWS
- Has a start and an end
- Batch will dynamically launch EC2 instances or Spot Instances
- AWS Batch provisions the right amount of compute / memory
- You submit or schedule batch jobs and AWS Batch does the rest!
- Batch jobs are defined as Docker images and run on ECS
- Helpful for cost optimizations and focusing less on the infrastructure

### Elastic Beanstalk

- Beanstalk = Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Beanstalk is free but you pay for the underlying instances
- Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
- We have full control over the configuration
- Just the application code is the responsibility of the developer

Managed service

- Instance configuration / OS is handled by Beanstalk
- Deployment strategy is configurable but performed by Elastic Beanstalk
- Capacity provisioning
- Load balancing & auto-scaling
- Application health-monitoring & responsiveness

Three architecture models:

- Single Instance deployment: good for dev
- LB + ASG: great for production or pre-production web applications
- ASG only: great for non-web apps in production (workers, etc..)
