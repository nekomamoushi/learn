# Organizations

- Global service
- Allows to manage multiple AWS accounts
- The main account is the master account
- Cost Benefits:
  - Consolidated Billing across all accounts - single payment method
  - Pricing benefits from aggregated usage (volume discount for EC2, S3...)
  - Pooling of Reserved EC2 instances for optimal savings
- API is available to automate AWS account creation
- Restrict account privileges using Service Control Policies (SCP)

## Multi Account Strategies

- Create accounts per department, per cost center, per dev / test / prod, based on regulatory restrictions (using SCP), for better resource isolation (ex:VPC), to have separate per-account service limits, isolated account for logging
- Multi Account vs One Account Multi VPC
- Use tagging standards for billing purposes
- Enable CloudTrail on all accounts, send logs to central S3 account
- Send CloudWatch Logs to central logging account

## Service Control Policies (SCP)

- Whitelist or blacklist IAM actions
- Applied at the OU or Account level
- Does not apply to the Master Account
- SCP is applied to all the Users and Roles of the Account, including Root user
- The SCP does not affect service-linked roles
  - Service-linked roles enable other AWS services to integrate with AWS Organizations
    and can't be restricted by SCPs.
- SCP must have an explicit Allow (does not allow anything by default)
- Use cases:
  - Restrict access to certain services (for example: canâ€™t use EMR)
  - Enforce PCI compliance by explicitly disabling services

## Consolidated billing

- One bill
  - One bill for multiple accounts
- Easy tracking
  - You can track the charges across multiple accounts and download the combined cost and usage data.
- Combined usage
  - You can combine the usage across all accounts in the organization to share the volume pricing discounts and Reserved Instance discounts. This can result in a lower charge for your project, department, or company than with individual standalone accounts.
- No extra fee
  - Consolidated billing is offered at no additional cost.
- Easy to track charges and allocate costs.
- Volume pricing discounts can be applied to resources.
- Consolidated billing allows you to get volume discounts on all of your accounts.
- Unused reserved instances (RIs) for EC2 are applied across the group.
